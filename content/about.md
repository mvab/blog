| Hello, world!

My name is Marina, welcome to my blog.

I’m a PhD student at the University of Bristol at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit. My work is somewhere at the intersection of Epidemiology and Data Mining, and it’s an exciting time to be in either of those fields.

My background in bioinformatics and direct-to-consumer genetics, and currently I’m interested in Health Data Science.

I like good visualisations, tidy workflows, existent documentation, using git, and reproducible science. And I’m on the journey to get better at all of those things.

In this blog I intend to talk about data visualisations and workflows I create for my projects and share any (hopefully) useful insights into new methods and tricks I discover along the way. | ![pic](/img/marina-logo-large.gif) |
