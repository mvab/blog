This blogplot is data story about critical care hospital occupancy rate in Bristol, in the winter of 2018-2019 (pre-COVID), for adults, children, and infants. It was originally submitted for a Christmas-themed data visualisation challenge at MRC-IEU programme 4 ([challenge details](https://github.com/MRCIEU/P4winter-viz-challenge)). 

  * _Dataset from NHS England_: [Winter SitRep: Acute Time series 3 December 2018 to 3 March 2019](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/winter-daily-sitreps/winter-daily-sitrep-2018-19-data/)
  * _Visualisation tools_: R packages **circilize** ([https://github.com/jokergoo/circlize](https://github.com/jokergoo/circlize)) and **ComplexHeatmap** ([Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html))


### Background

The dataset contains critical care bed occupancy rate in all NHS Trusts across England from December 2018 to February 2019 (pre-COVID data). In my analysis/visualisation, I focus on Bristol data only.

Hospitals in Bristol are split between two NHS Trusts - _North Bristol NHS Trust_ and _University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust_, which cover the north and centre/south of the city, respectively. For context, below is the list of hospitals that belong to the two trusts [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Bristol#NHS_trusts_and_hospitals)]:


North Bristol NHS Trust  (**NBT**) manages hospitals in the north of Bristol and South Gloucestershire.

- Southmead Hospital
- Cossham Memorial Hospital
- Frenchay Hospital


University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust (**UHB**) manages hospitals in the centre and south of the city, and at Weston-super-Mare.

- Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI)
- Bristol Heart Institute
- Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre
- South Bristol Community Hospital
- Bristol Royal Hospital for Children 
- St. Michael's Hospital
- Bristol Eye Hospital
- University of Bristol Dental Hospital

### Analysis

We are going to look at critical care bed occupancy rate for adults, children (<14 years), and infants (<6 months) in these two Bristol-based NHS Trusts (**NBT** & **UHB**), and visualise how occupancy rate changed over the winter months (especially during the holidays period! `r emo::ji("christmas")`)

**Load data**

Reading the xls file and converting the data into the long format.
```{r}
load_data <- function(file, sheet){
      # function to load and tidy data from a specified sheet in the xls file

      # read the dat in the specified sheet
      dat<- read.xlsx(xlsxFile = file, 
                        fillMergedCells = TRUE, colNames = FALSE, 
                        sheet = sheet, rows = c(13:151))
      
      # store NHS trust names and location separately
      nhs_labels <- dat %>% select(region = X1, code = X3, Name= X4)
      nhs_labels <- nhs_labels[5:nrow(nhs_labels),]
      
      # store main data
      data_values <- dat %>% select(X4:X277)
      
      # vector of dates read in numerical format
      dates_numerical <- data_values[2, 2:274]
      # vector of value types
      colnames_vector <- data_values[3, 2:274]
      
      # create value type+date vector
      new_names <-paste(colnames_vector, dates_numerical,sep='_')
      
      # keep only values + add new colnames
      data_values_only <- data_values[4:138,1:274]
      colnames(data_values_only) <- c("Name", new_names )
      
      # pivot data to long format; split type_date; convert date_numerical to Date; add NHS Trust labels
      out <- data_values_only %>% 
                 pivot_longer(!Name, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") %>% 
                 separate(col=variable, into=c("variable", "date"), sep = "_") %>% 
                 mutate(date = openxlsx::convertToDate(date)) %>% 
                 left_join(nhs_labels, by = "Name") %>% 
                 arrange(region)
      return(out)
}


dat_adult <- load_data(file = filename, sheet = "Adult critical care")
#preview
dat_adult %>% head %>% kable_it()
```

**Process data**

Subsetting the data to Bristol NHS Trusts, and extracting bed occupancy rates for all winter day in the two NHS Trusts.

```{r}
process_data <- function(data){
      # function to subset data to Bristol/occupancy data only 
      
      # subset to Bristol
      data_region <- data %>% 
                mutate(value=as.numeric(value)) %>% 
                filter(grepl("Bristol", Name)) %>% 
                mutate(abbr = case_when(Name == "University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust" ~ "UHB",
                                        Name == "North Bristol NHS Trust" ~"\nNBT"))
              
      # keep only Occupancy data
      data_region_occ <- data_region %>% 
                filter(grepl("Occupancy", variable))
        
      # pivot data to wide format and keep winter only
      data_region_occ_wide <- data_region_occ %>% 
                 pivot_wider(id_cols=date, names_from = abbr, values_from = value, values_fill = NA) %>% 
                 # extarct month from the date and create column with month name labels (set order with factor)
                 mutate(month = lubridate::month(date, label=T, abbr=F)) %>%
                 filter(month %in% c("December", "January" , "February")) %>% 
                 mutate(month = factor(month, levels = c("December", "January" , "February"))) %>% 
                 # create dat in 01-Dec format for the plot
                 mutate(DayDate=lubridate::day(date)) %>%
                 mutate(MonthDate=month(date, label=T)) %>%
                 unite(DayMonth, c("DayDate", "MonthDate"), sep = "-")
        
      # keep month labels as a separate variable - will be used in viz for sectors
      split <- data_region_occ_wide$month
      
      # tidy the output
      data_region_occ_wide<-
                 data_region_occ_wide %>% 
                 column_to_rownames('DayMonth') %>% 
                 select( "UHB",  "\nNBT") # arrange in the order to appear on the plot
      
      return(list(
        full_bristol_data = data_region,
        wide_data = data_region_occ_wide,
        split = split
  ))
}

dat_adult_bristol <- process_data(dat_adult)
dat_adult_bristol$wide_data %>% head() %>% kable_it()
```


**Visualise data (circular heatmap)**

Here I define the plotting function - 

```{r}
plot_circular_heatmap <- function(df,  title_prefix){
      # function to draw a circular heatmap; inspired by - 
      # https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/circos-heatmap.html
      
      split <- df$split
      df<- df$wide_data
    
      # create color palette green-white-red (min to max occupancy)
      vals <- c(df$`\nNBT`, df$`UHB`)
      min <- round(min(vals[!is.na(vals)]),1)
      mid = (1+min)/2
      col_fun1 = colorRamp2(c(min, mid ,1), c("#0F3C28", "white", "#A7111C"))
      
      # build plot by layers
      circos.clear()
      circos.par( gap.degree = c(5,5,20), start.degree = 150) 
      circos.heatmap(df,  col = col_fun1, track.height = 0.4, rownames.side = "outside", 
                     cluster=F, split = split, show.sector.labels = T,
                     bg.border = "grey", bg.lwd = 1, bg.lty = 1)
      
      circos.track(track.index = get.current.track.index(), panel.fun = function(x, y) {
        if(CELL_META$sector.numeric.index == 1) { # the last sector
          cn = rev(colnames(df))
          n = length(cn)
          circos.text(x = rep(CELL_META$cell.xlim[2]+63, n) + convert_x(1, "mm"),  # 63 is a magic number for moving track labels around the axis
                      y = 1:n - 3, 
                      labels = cn, 
                      cex = 0.8, 
                      adj = c(0, 1), 
                      facing = "inside")
        }
      }, bg.border = NA)
      lgd = Legend(title = paste0(title_prefix,"\nbed occupancy"), col_fun = col_fun1)
      grid.draw(lgd)

}

### Data story - critical care bed occupancy rate in Bristol NHS Trusts, during a pre-COVID winter

<br>

**Adult critical care**

The critical care occupancy rate (percentage of the available beds taken) is presented as a colour gradient heatmap: from green (beds available) to red (occupancy close to 100%). The data for NBT and UHB is shown as two separate tracks of the heatmap, going clockwise from December to February. 
```{r}
suppressMessages(
  plot_circular_heatmap(df=dat_adult_bristol,  "Adult critical care"))

```


 - UBH (n_beds=55) was very busy during the entire winter season (mean occupancy 93%) 
 - The only days with occupancy < 80% at UHB were Christmas and Boxing Days `r emo::ji("christmas")`
 - NBT (n_beds=46) was busy too (mean occupancy 76%), but there were fewer people in the critical care in NBT over the entire holiday season (~ 20-Dec to 6-Jan) `r emo::ji("christmas")`)


```{r}
# mean occupancy
round(colMeans(dat_adult_bristol$wide_data),2) 
```

```{r}
# show the total number of available beds in each NHS Trust
dat_adult_bristol$full_bristol_data  %>% 
  select(Name, abbr, variable, open_beds = value) %>% 
  mutate(abbr = gsub("\n", "", abbr)) %>% 
  filter(variable == "CC Adult Open") %>% 
  count(Name, abbr, open_beds) %>% filter(n>2) %>% select(-n)  %>% kable_it()
```

<br>

**Paediatric intensive care**

Next, we look at bed occupancy rate in paediatric intensive care units, i.e. children (< 14 years)

```{r message=""}
# reusing the function defined for the adult critical care
dat_child <- load_data(file = filename,  sheet = "Paediatric intensive care")
dat_child_bristol <- process_data(dat_child)

suppressMessages(
  plot_circular_heatmap(df=dat_child_bristol,  "Paedeatric \nintensive care"))
```

- Paediatric intensive care in Bristol is only available at UHB (likely at the _Bristol Royal Hospital for Children_), with mean occupancy 65%
- Therefore, no data is presented for NBT in the plot
- Bed occupancy was quite low in the paediatric intensive care between 25-Dec and 7-Jan: < 50%  `r emo::ji("christmas")` `r emo::ji("christmas")` `r emo::ji("christmas")`

```{r}
# mean occupancy
round(colMeans(dat_child_bristol$wide_data),2)
```

```{r}
# show the total number of available beds* in each NHS Trust
dat_child_bristol$full_bristol_data  %>% 
  select(Name, abbr, variable, open_beds = value) %>% 
  filter(variable == "Paed Int Care Open") %>% 
  mutate(abbr = gsub("\n", "", abbr)) %>% 
  count(Name, abbr, open_beds) %>% select(-n) %>% kable_it()
```

*- The number of beds went from 33 to 18 on the 19th of December

**Neonatal intensive care (NICU)**

Finally, we look at occupancy rates in neonatal intensive care units (children at < 6 months)

```{r}
dat_baby <- load_data(file = filename, sheet = "Neonatal intensive care ")
dat_baby_bristol <- process_data(dat_baby)
suppressMessages(
     plot_circular_heatmap(df=dat_baby_bristol,  "Neonatal \nintensive care "))
```

- NBT and UHB have a similar number of NICU beds (30/31)
- NBT was busier (92% mean occupancy), with ~100% beds taken from 23-Dec to 23-Jan
- At UHB a smaller number of beds were occupied from 24-Dec to 5-Jan `r emo::ji("christmas")`



```{r}
# mean occupancy
round(colMeans(dat_baby_bristol$wide_data),2)
```

```{r}
# show the total number of available beds in each NHS Trust
dat_baby_bristol$full_bristol_data  %>%
  select(Name, abbr, variable, open_beds = value) %>% 
  filter(variable == "Neo Int Care Open") %>% 
  mutate(abbr = gsub("\n", "", abbr)) %>% 
  count(Name, abbr, open_beds) %>% filter(n>10) %>% select(-n)  %>% kable_it()
```

<br>
<br>

**Final thoughts**

- Critical care bed occupancy rate was high during the winter season pre-Covid
- High occupancy rate in neonatal intensive care may not be winter-season related
- Overall, there were less adults and children in critical care over the holiday season `r emo::ji("christmas")` `r emo::ji("christmas")` `r emo::ji("christmas")`
