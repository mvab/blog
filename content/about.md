My name is Marina and I’m a PhD student at the University of Bristol, MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit. Welcome to my data analysis blog! 

My background is in Bioinformatics and Direct-to-Consumer Genetics, and currently I’m interested in Health Data Science. In my PhD work I will be trying to answer causal relationship questions in Epidemiology using methods from Data Mining and Machine Learning.

I like good visualisations, tidy workflows, existent documentation, using git, and reproducible science. And I’m on the journey of getting better at all of those things.

In this blog I intend to talk about data visualisations and workflows I create for my projects and share any (hopefully) useful insights into new methods and tricks I discover along the way.
