Hello, world!

My name is Marina, welcome to my blog.

I’m a PhD student at the University of Bristol at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, and in my main PhD work will be using methods from Data Mining to help answer causal relationship questions in Epidemiology.

My background in bioinformatics and direct-to-consumer genetics, and currently I’m interested in Health Data Science.

I like good visualisations, tidy workflows, existent documentation, using git, and reproducible science. And I’m on the journey of getting better at all of those things.

In this blog I intend to talk about data visualisations and workflows I create for my projects and share any (hopefully) useful insights into new methods and tricks I discover along the way.
